## 머  리  말
## 한국은행은 국민들이 경제와 금융에 대해 보다 깊이 이해하여 급변하는 경제 환경
## 속에서 합리적인 의사결정을 내릴 수 있도록 현장 경제교육, 온라인 경제교육 등 다양한
## 대국민 경제교육을 꾸준히 수행해 왔습니다.
## 이의 일환으로 한국은행은 2018년 『경제금융용어 700선』을 처음 발간하여 학생,
## 교수, 연구원 등 다양한 독자층으로부터 큰 관심을 받아왔습니다. 한국은행은 이와
## 같은 독자들의 호응에 따라 이 책자를 2025년까지 총 15회에 걸쳐 꾸준히 추가 발간
## 하였습니다. 그러나 근래 들어 국내외 경제·금융 환경이 급속히 변모함에 따라 한국
## 은행은 최근의 트렌드와 경제·금융 환경 변화를 반영하여 『경제금융용어 700선』을
## 『경제금융용어 800선』으로 확대하여 개정 발간하게 되었습니다.
## 이번 개정판에서는 통화정책, 실물경제, 금융안정, 지급결제 등 한국은행의 핵심
## 정책 분야를 이해하는 데 필요한 필수 용어를 변화한 현실에 맞게 가다듬고, 중앙은행
## 디지털화폐(CBDC), 인공지능(AI), 탄소중립경제 등과 같이 기술혁신 및 글로벌 경제
## 환경 변화로 새롭게 부상한 경제·금융 용어들을 대폭 추가 수록하였습니다.
## 아울러 각 용어 해설은 기본 개념뿐 아니라 도입 배경, 정책적 의미, 국제적 논의,
## 실제 활용 사례 등을 균형 있게 담아 독자들이 경제·금융 흐름을 보다 깊이있게 이해할
## 수 있도록 하였습니다.
## 세계 경제는 디지털 전환, 녹색 전환 등 과거와는 다른 새로운 변화의 국면에 진입
## 하였습니다. 이러한 변화 속에서 경제·금융 현상에 대한 국민들의 관심과 정보 수요는
## 더욱 커지고 있습니다. 아무쪼록 이 책자가 독자들의 국내외 경제와 한국은행 정책에
## 대한 이해도를 높여 독자들이 경제적 의사결정에서 합리적 선택을 하는 데 좋은 길잡이가
## 되기를 바라겠습니다.
